Welcome to my own website. The goal of this website is to provide guides and tooling for mappers of osu!catch. The site is still in its early stages so not much can be found here yet.

So far the site contains of tools which can do the following:

- Calculate the trigger distance of a hyperdash
- Calculate the ideal slider velocity for your difficulty
- Calculate if a snapping is unrankable at the given BPM

If other tooling is desired then feel free to contact me via discord (Greaper#0001) or open a github issue at [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Darius-Wattimena/greaper-website/issues).
