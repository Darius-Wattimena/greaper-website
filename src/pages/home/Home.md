Welcome to my own website. The goal of this website is to provide guides and tooling for mappers of osu!catch. The site is still in its early stages so not much can be found here yet.

None of the guides are currently done, but I have the following planned:

- Introduction to rhythm / basics of music
- How does flow work
- How to set up a pattern
- Commonly used patterning

Besides this I also intend to make tooling that can help mappers, so far only a [a handful of tools](/tools) are available for use. Those are:

- Hyperdash Trigger Distance Calculator
- Ideal Slider Velocity Calculator
- Snapping Category Specifier (for basic-snapped / higher-snapped)

If other tooling is desired then feel free to contact me via discord (Greaper#0001).
