**Welcome! The goal of this website is to provide tooling for osu!catch mappers.**

So far the site can help you with the following:

- Calculate the ideal slider velocity for your difficulty.
- Calculate the basic-snapped, higher-snapped and unrankable snap for any given BPM.
- Calculate the trigger distance of a hyperdash.
- Calculate an indication what dash distances you can use.


## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for new tools or features, please let me know! I am always looking to improve the site and add new functionality that can help mappers. 

To make me aware of your suggestions, you can either open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Darius-Wattimena/greaper-website/issues), contact me via osu by sending [me a DM](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/messages/users/2369776) or by contacting me directly via Discord by messaging _greaper_.
