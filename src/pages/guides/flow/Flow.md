# Flow; Definiton and Examples.

### What is Flow?
Probably one of the most ambiguous terms in mapping, Flow can be described as the **effect a pattern has on playability and expression.** In osu!catch, **Flow is the direct connection of movement with the song itself, as well as the patterns used.** It's the way the catcher moves through a pattern, how the pattern itself plays and its overall strain/difficulty comparatively to how intense the song's pace is.

In general, flow has been somewhat connected, *informally*, with how a pattern "feels" while playing. However this feeling is a really ambiguous term to use, which is the reason why this term has also been ambiguous. One way to explain how to explain the "feeling" of a pattern is to break down its objects and see how it moves between them.

**Movement is one of the more important forms of emphasis in osu!catch.** For example, moving too little towards a strong sound or moving too much, or in a strainful way while the pace of the song is calmer might give a negative effect on the pattern. Through playtesting, someone might get this exact "feeling", thinking that they didnt "feel" a good connection of the pattern with the song itself. 

Consequently, even though it's a bit more subjective, is a process which should be undertaken when creating a beatmap. Playtesting is a vital part of osu!catch mapping for reasons such as this one.

### Types of Flow
While there isnt a specfic amount of *types* , every pattern can be broken down into these categories of transitions, so flow can be directly correlated with all of them.
#### Antiflow
Antiflow is a transition between two objects in which, you have to change directions on the destination object in order to follow the pattern.

This is an example of antiflow, the catcher has to direction change after catching the sliderhead, otherwise the player will miss. It requires more key inputs *( you have to change directions )* to not miss and follow the flow *( the movement needed )*'

#### Normal / Comfortable Flow 
Cotrasting antiflow, normal flow is a transition between two objects in which there is no direction change after, resulting in a generally easier movement, since there isnt any extra key input.

#### Standstilling / Vertical Flow
Another form of flow is vertical flow, where the point of arrival is a completely vertical slider set of circles. To catch perfectly, there needs to be an extra keystroke in the other direction to stop the catcher, but there is no followup movement. This creates a standstill, a moment where the catcher doesnt move at all.

#### Flowbreaks
Vertical flow or Antiflow can Create an effect called a "flowbreak" , a case where the usual normal flow used in the previous patterns is stopped by the usage of antiflow/vertical flow. It is a nice tool to use when you want to create contrast between patterns.

A nice rule of thumb for beginners is to attempt to create patterns that move according to the song, so they represent it well ( More on that in the patterning chapter ) . To conclude, flow is created by using these type of direction changes/movements to actively map in a way that matches the songs pace/strength as well as moving accordingly.
