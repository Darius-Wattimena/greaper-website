# Flow

Probably one of the most ambiguous terms in mapping, flow can be described as the effect a pattern has on playability and expression. In osu!catch, flow is the direct connection of movement with the song and the patterns used. It's how the catcher moves through a pattern, how the pattern itself plays and its overall strain/difficulty compared to how intense the song's pace is.

Flow is somewhat connected with how a pattern _feels_ while playing. One way to explain the feeling of a pattern is to break down its objects and see how it moves between them.

**Movement is key.** osu!catch has only an x-axis. Because of this, we can only emphasise a sound with movement. For example, moving too little toward a strong sound would have a negative effect on both the pattern and the player playing it. Because movement is key, playtesting your map is vital to ensure that your provided emphasis is correct.

## Types of Flow

There are three different types of flow in osu!catch:

- **Flow**
- **Anti-flow**
- **Standstill**

This doesn't mean you can label every slider as a particular type of flow. For example, a circular slider has flow, anti-flow and a bit of standstill simultaneously, thus making it an exception. Although we will go more in-depth with this per type of flow, giving definitions and providing examples for each.

### Flow

You can classify something as Flow when the movement between two objects can be caught without having to press a new direction key.

An example of flow can be seen below. Here we originated from the right side of the screen. Catching the next fruit (the circle on the left) has no direction change. This is called a _flowing movement_.

The same logic applies to dashes as well. While the two objects are not walkable, it does require the player to press the dash key. There is still no direction change provided, making it flow to the left.

Like with dashes, the same applies to hyperdashes as well. With the below example, we have the same scenario. The player needs to use their dash key to catch the next fruit, and there is still no need to press a new direction key as the hyperdash flows to the left.

### Anti-flow

Anti-flow is a movement between two objects in which a new direction key needs to be pressed to catch the next object. For example, if you currently hold the left movement key, switching to the right movement key to catch the next object is anti-flow.

An example of anti-flow can be seen below. Here we are provided with a hyperdash followed by a slider going towards the side we came from. Because we have to make a sudden change in motion, we call this side the unnatural side. The slider-body of 2 is classified as an anti-flow slider because of the abnormal movement. The movement between the hyper-fruit and the slider-head of 2 would be classified as flow.

### Standstill

Standstill is a term for vertical flow. This flow type can be seen as one of the most straightforward. Here no movement is needed to catch the next object, making the catcher stand still.

### Flowbreak

Once anti-flow or a standstill is provided, an effect is created, which is called a flow break. Providing a flow break is a way of creating contrast between patterns. For example, only giving flow in your map would become boring and easy to play.

To conclude, flow is created by using the three types of flow changes to actively map in a way that matches the pace and strength of the song and moves accordingly.
