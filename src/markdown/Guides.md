# Available Guides

On this part of my website you can find a handful of guides that can help you get started mapping the gamemode osu!catch. If you are a beginner I highly suggest you to start reading up the Basic topics (even for those that have experience in mapping in other gamemodes).

## Basic Topics

- [Flow](/guides/flow)
- [Structure](/guides/structure) (WIP)
- Basic patterning (WIP)
- Finding the SV for your difficulty (WIP)
- How to map to the music (WIP)
